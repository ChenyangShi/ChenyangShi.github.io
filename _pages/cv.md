======
* 08/2018: Kaggle Featured - Home Credit Default Risk ([Link: competition profile](https://www.kaggle.com/herlobster))    
  Top 8% Brown Medal, Group Leader.
  * Achieved exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, increasing features from 200 to 1000.
  * Trained and evaluated 5 machine learning models (Lightgbm, Xgboost, Catboost, Neural Network and Stacking) with cross-validation to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan.
  * Extracted and reprocessed time series related features to dramatically increase the final AUC score, and it turned out those features are **'magic'** ones.
  * Performed Bayesian Optimization to find the optimal combination of hyper-parameters.
  * Advanced the final model based on Stacking, which ended up with local AUC: 0.7979 and private board: 0.795, ranking **top 8\%**.
